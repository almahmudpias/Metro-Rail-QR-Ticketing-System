# **Metro Rail QR Code Ticketing System**
## **Undergraduate Project for the Course Software Engineering ( CSE 327 )**

### **Project Description**
The **Metro Rail QR Code Ticketing System** is a web-based train ticket management platform inspired by Dhaka's latest Metro Rail project. This application aims to provide a reliable and efficient experience for Metro Rail passengers, contributing to the vision of **Digital Bangladesh**. The application is user-friendly, visually appealing, and fully functional, with minor bugs.  

This system is designed to accommodate two types of users: passengers and trainmasters. It simplifies ticketing processes and reduces daily hassles for both user groups. Passengers no longer need to wait in long lines to purchase tickets; instead, they can easily buy tickets online. Furthermore, passengers do not need to carry physical tickets as our system generates **digital tickets** embedded with QR codes, which can be downloaded immediately after payment.
